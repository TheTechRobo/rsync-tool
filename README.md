# rsync-tool
 sync two folders together using a single command
 
# Instructions
 you will need to do the following:
 
- modify the .sh file for your source and destination folders
- open your terminal
- chmod +x rsync.sh
- ./rsync.sh
- you will need to run it whenever you want to sync it, it is not continuous


# Making it Easier
I am about to upload a file called 'Sync Two Folders.app'
it's an Automator script
to modify the paths just open Automator. 
File>Open
Navigate to the script
And change the stuff
after that save it
and you can run the app whenever to sync the two folders. 
you can add your own Automator blocks to e.g. add a notification 'Successful!'
